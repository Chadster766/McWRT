	  If you have a network (Ethernet) chipset belonging to this class,
	  say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question does not directly affect
	  the kernel: saying N will just case the configurator to skip all
	  the questions regarding AMD chipsets. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific chipset/driver in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_CAVIUM

	select PHYLIB
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use built-in Ethernet ports
	  on CNS3XXX processor.
