          The eXtensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI) is standard for USB 3.0
          "SuperSpeed" host controller hardware.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
          module will be called xhci-hcd.

          This will spew debugging output, even in interrupt context.
          This should only be used for debugging xHCI driver bugs.

          If unsure, say N.
