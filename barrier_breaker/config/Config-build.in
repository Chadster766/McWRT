	config ALL
		bool "Select all packages by default"
		default n

	comment "General build options"

	config DISPLAY_SUPPORT
		bool "Show packages that require graphics support (local or remote)"
		default n

	config BUILD_PATENTED
		default y
		bool "Compile with support for patented functionality"
		help
		  When this option is disabled, software which provides patented functionality will not be built.
		  In case software provides optional support for patented functionality,
		  this optional support will get disabled for this package.

	config BUILD_NLS
		default n
		bool "Compile with full language support"
		help
		  When this option is enabled, packages are built with the full versions of iconv and GNU gettext
		  instead of the default OpenWrt stubs. If uClibc is used, it is also built with locale support.

	config BUILD_STATIC_TOOLS
		default n
		bool "Attempt to link host utilities statically"
		help
		  Linking host utilities like sed or firmware-utils statically increases the portability of the
		  generated ImageBuilder and SDK tarballs, however it may fail on some Linux distributions.

	config SHADOW_PASSWORDS
		bool
		prompt "Enable shadow password support"
		default y
		help
		  Enable shadow password support.

	config CLEAN_IPKG
		bool
		prompt "Remove ipkg/opkg status data files in final images"
		default n
		help
		  This removes all ipkg/opkg status data files from the target directory before building the root fs

	config COLLECT_KERNEL_DEBUG
		bool
		prompt "Collect kernel debug information"
		select KERNEL_DEBUG_INFO
		default n
		help
		  This collects debugging symbols from the kernel and all compiled modules.
		  Useful for release builds, so that kernel issues can be debugged offline later.

	config DEBUG
		bool
		prompt "Compile packages with debugging info"
		default n
		help
		  Adds -g3 to the CFLAGS

	config IPV6
		bool
		prompt "Enable IPv6 support in packages"
		default y
		help
		  Enable IPV6 support in packages (passes --enable-ipv6 to configure scripts).

	config PKG_BUILD_PARALLEL
		bool
		prompt "Compile certain packages parallelized"
		default y
		help
		  This adds a -jX option to certain packages that are known to
		  behave well for parallel build. By default the package make processes
		  use the main jobserver, in which case this option only takes effect
		  when you add -jX to the make command.

		  If you are unsure, select N.

	config PKG_BUILD_USE_JOBSERVER
		bool
		prompt "Use top-level make jobserver for packages"
		depends on PKG_BUILD_PARALLEL
		default y
		help
		  This passes the main make process jobserver fds to package builds,
		  enabling full parallelization across different packages

		  Note that disabling this may overcommit CPU resources depending on the
		  -j level of the main make process, the number of package
		  submake jobs selected below and the number of actual CPUs present.
		  Example: If the main make is passed a -j4 and the submake -j
		  is also set to 4, we may end up with 16 parallel make processes
		  in the worst case.


	config PKG_BUILD_JOBS
		int
		prompt "Number of package submake jobs (2-512)"
		range 2 512
		default 2
		depends on PKG_BUILD_PARALLEL && !PKG_BUILD_USE_JOBSERVER
		help
		  The number of jobs (-jX) to pass to packages submake.

	config PKG_DEFAULT_PARALLEL
		bool
		prompt "Parallelize the default package build rule (May break build)"
		depends on PKG_BUILD_PARALLEL
		depends on BROKEN
		default n
		help
		  Always set the default package build rules to parallel build.

		  WARNING: This may break build or kill your cat, as it builds
		  packages with multiple jobs that are probably not tested in
		  a parallel build environment.

		  Only say Y, if you don't mind fixing broken packages.
		  Before reporting build bugs, set this to N and re-run the build.

		default USE_SSTRIP

		  Select the binary stripping method you wish to use.

		config NO_STRIP
			bool "none"
			help
			  This will install unstripped binaries (useful for native compiling/debugging)

		config USE_STRIP
			bool "strip"
			help
			  This will install binaries stripped using strip from binutils


		config USE_SSTRIP
			bool "sstrip"
			depends on !DEBUG
			depends on !USE_GLIBC

		default "--strip-all"
		help
		  Specifies arguments passed to the strip command when stripping binaries

	config STRIP_KERNEL_EXPORTS
		bool "Strip unnecessary exports from the kernel image"
		help
		  Reduces kernel size by stripping unused kernel exports from the kernel image
		  Note that this might make the kernel incompatible with any kernel modules that
		  were not selected at the time the kernel image was created

	config USE_MKLIBS
		bool "Strip unnecessary functions from libraries"
		help
		  Reduces libraries to only those functions that are necessary for using all
		  selected packages (including those selected as <M>)
		  Note that this will make the system libraries incompatible with most of the packages
		  that are not selected during the build process

	choice
		prompt "Preferred standard C++ library"
		default USE_LIBSTDCXX if USE_EGLIBC
		default USE_UCLIBCXX
		help
		  Select the preferred standard C++ library for all packages that support this.

		config USE_UCLIBCXX
