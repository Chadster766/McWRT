Subject: [PATCH v2] mtd: m25p80: Add support for ESMT F25L32PA

This flashchip is used in D-Link DIR-610 A1 router board 
and maybe several others, yet is not kernel upstream.

So add support for it according to datasheet [0], making it easier
to support other boards using this flashchip in the future.

Changelog v2:
 - Better description
 - Datasheet link at the bottom, similar to other patches.
