The patches-* subdirectories contain the kernel patches applied for every
OpenWrt target. All patches should be named 'NNN-lowercase_shortname.patch'
and sorted into the following categories:

0xx - upstream backports
1xx - code awaiting upstream merge
2xx - kernel build / config / header patches
3xx - architecture specific patches
4xx - mtd related patches (subsystem and drivers)
5xx - filesystem related patches
6xx - generic network patches
7xx - network / phy driver patches
8xx - other drivers
9xx - uncategorized other patches

ALL patches must be in a way that they are potentially upstreamable, meaning:

- they must contain a proper subject
- they must contain a proper commit message explaining what they change
- they must contain a valid Signed-off-by line
