Although the commit "98af057092f8f0dabe63c5df08adc2bbfbddb1d2
 ARM: 6126/1: ARM mpcore_wdt: fix build failure and other fixes"
resolved long standing mpcore_wdt driver build problems, it
introduced an error in the relationship between the MPcore watchdog
timer clock rate and mpcore_margin, "MPcore timer margin in seconds",
such that watchdog timeouts are now arbitrary rather than the number
of seconds specified by mpcore_margin.

This change restores mpcore_wdt_keepalive() to its equivalent
implementation prior to commit 98af057 such that watchdog timeouts now
occur as specified by mpcore_margin.

The variable 'mpcore_timer_rate' which caused that build failure was
replaced by 'twd_timer_rate'. Adding exported function to obtain
'twd_timer_rate' value in mpcore_wdt driver.

MPCORE_WATCHDOG needed to build 'mpcore_wdt' already depends on
HAVE_ARM_TWD needed to build 'smp_twd', so from the point of view of
'mpcore_wdt' driver the exported function will always exist.
