Subject: [PATCH 076/196] sdhci-bcm2807: Increase sync_after_dma timeout

The current timeout is being hit with some cards that complete successfully with a longer timeout.
The timeout is not handled well, and is believed to be a code path that causes corruption.
872a8ff suggests that crappy cards can take up to 3 seconds to respond
