Subject: [PATCH] ARM: sun7i: dt: Add board support for LinkSprite pcDuino V3

The LinkSprite pcDuino V3 is an A20-based revision of the
earlier pcDuinos. This series will add support for the board,
along with some of its devices where the driver is accepted or
soon-to-be-accepted into mainline.

Changes since v2:
 - update MMC entry to comply with upstream
 - unify the 4 patches into one

Changes since v1:
 - fix cosmetic issues
 - fix i2c entry
 - remove unnecessary input bindings include
 - add MMC support
