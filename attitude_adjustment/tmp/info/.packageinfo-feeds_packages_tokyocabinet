Description:  Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database.
 The database is a simple data file containing records, each
 is a pair of a key and a value. Every key and value is serial bytes
 with variable length. Both binary data and character string can be
 used as a key and a value. There is neither concept of data tables
 nor data types. Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree,
 or fixed-length array.

 Tokyo Cabinet is developed as the successor of GDBM and QDBM on the
 following purposes. They are achieved and Tokyo Cabinet replaces
 conventional DBM products.
