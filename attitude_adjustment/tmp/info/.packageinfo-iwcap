Title: Simple radiotap capture utility
Maintainer: Jo-Philipp Wich <jow@openwrt.org>
Source: 
Type: ipkg
Description:   The iwcap utility receives radiotap packet data from wifi monitor interfaces
  and outputs it to pcap format. It gathers recived packets in a fixed ring
  buffer to dump them on demand which is useful for background monitoring.
  Alternatively the utility can stream the data to stdout to act as remote
  capture drone for Wireshark or similar programs.
