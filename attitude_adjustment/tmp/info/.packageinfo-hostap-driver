Kernel-Config: CONFIG_HOSTAP CONFIG_HOSTAP_FIRMWARE=y CONFIG_HOSTAP_FIRMWARE_NVRAM=y
Description:  Host AP is a driver for 802.11b wireless cards based on Intersil 
 Prism2/2.5/3 chipset. It supports so called Host AP mode that allows the 
 card to act as an IEEE 802.11 access point.
 This package contains the base Host AP driver code that is shared by 
 different hardware models. You will also need to enable support for 
 PLX/PCI/CS version of the driver to actually use the driver.
