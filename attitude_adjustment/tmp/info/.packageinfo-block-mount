Description:   Scripts used to mount and check block devices (filesystems and swap), as well
  as hotplug scripts to automount and check block devices when hotplug event (e.g.
  from plugging in a device) occurs.
  Also includes preinit scripts for mounting a block device as the root filesystem.
  This allows one to have the root filesystem on devices other than the built in flash
  device.
