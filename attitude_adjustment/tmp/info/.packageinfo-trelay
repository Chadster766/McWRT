Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: 
Type: ipkg
Description: trelay relays ethernet packets between two devices (similar to a bridge), but
without any MAC address checks. This makes it possible to bridge client mode
or ad-hoc mode wifi devices to ethernet VLANs, assuming the remote end uses
the same source MAC address as the device that packets are supposed to exit
from.
