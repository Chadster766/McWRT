Description:   sslstrip will transparently hijack HTTP traffic on a network,
  watch for HTTPS links and redirects, then map those links
  into either look-alike HTTP links or homograph-similar HTTPS
  links. It also supports modes for supplying a favicon which
  looks like a lock icon, selective logging, and session denial.
