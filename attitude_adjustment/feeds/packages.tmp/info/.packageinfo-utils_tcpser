Title: Hayes compatible modem emulator
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: tcpser-1.0rc12.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:  TCPSER turns a PC serial port into an emulated Hayes compatible modem 
 that uses TCP/IP for incoming and outgoing connections. It can be used 
 to allow older applications and systems designed for modem use 
 to operate on the Internet. TCPSER supports all standard Hayes commands,
 and understands extended and vendor proprietary commands (though it does
 not implement many of them). TCPSER can be used for both inbound and 
 outbound connections.
