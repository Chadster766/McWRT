Title: Automatic Password generator
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: pwgen-2.06.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	pwgen generates random, meaningless but pronounceable passwords.
	These passwords contain either only lowercase letters, or upper
	and lower case mixed, or digits thrown in.
	Uppercase letters and digits are placed in a way that eases
	remembering their position when memorizing only the word.

	E.g. to generate a WPA preshared-key do:
	pwgen -c -n -s 63 1
