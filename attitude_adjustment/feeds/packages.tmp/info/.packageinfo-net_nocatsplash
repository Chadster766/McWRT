Description: 	NoCatSplash is an Open Public Network Gateway Daemon.
	It performs as a [captive/open/active] portal. When run on a gateway/router 
	on a network, all web requests are redirected until the client either logs 
	in or clicks "I Accept" to an AUP. The gateway daemon then changes the 
	firewall rules on the gateway to pass traffic for that client (based on IP 
	address and MAC address).
