Title: A program to ping multiple hosts in parallel
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: fping-2.4b2_to-ipv6.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	fping is a ping(1) like program which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol 
	(ICMP) echo request to determine if a host is up. fping is different from ping in 
	that you can specify any number of hosts on the command line, or specify a file 
	containing the lists of hosts to ping. Instead of trying one host until it timeouts 
	or replies, fping will send out a ping packet and move on to the next host in a 
	round-robin fashion. If a host replies, it is noted and removed from the list of 
	hosts to check. If a host does not respond within a certain time limit and/or retry 
	limit it will be considered unreachable.
