Source: scponly-4.8.tgz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	"scponly" is an alternative 'shell' (of sorts) for system
	administrators who would like to provide access to remote
	users to both read and write local files without providing
	any remote execution priviledges. Functionally, it is best
	described as a wrapper to the mostly trusted suite of ssh
	applications.
