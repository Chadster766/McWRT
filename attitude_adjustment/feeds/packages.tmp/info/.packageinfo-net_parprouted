Description: 	parprouted is a daemon for transparent IP (Layer 3) proxy ARP bridging.
	This is useful for creation of transparent firewalls and bridging networks
	with different MAC protocols. Also, unlike standard bridging, proxy ARP
	bridging allows to bridge Ethernet networks behind wireless nodes without
	using WDS or layer 2 bridging.
