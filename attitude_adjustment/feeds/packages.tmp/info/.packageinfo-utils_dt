Title: A generic data test program
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: dt-source.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:  dt is a generic data test program used to verify proper operation of peripherals,
 file systems, device drivers, or any data stream supported by the operating system.
 In its' simplest mode of operation, dt writes and then verifys its' default data pattern,
 then displays performance statisics and other test parameters before exiting.
 Since verification of data is performed, dt can be thought of as a generic diagnostic tool.
