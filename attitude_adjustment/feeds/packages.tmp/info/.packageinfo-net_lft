Description: 		LFT, short for Layer Four Traceroute, is a sort of 'traceroute' that
	often works much faster (than the commonly-used Van Jacobson method)
	and goes through many configurations of packet-filters (firewalls).
	More importantly, LFT implements numerous other features including AS

	netblock name lookups, et al.
	This package contains the lft 'traceroute' program.
