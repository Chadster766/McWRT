Description: 	Petitboot is a Linux kexec based bootloader with both
	graphical and command-line user interfaces. The OpenWRT
	Petitboot package has configuration options that can be
	used to specify which Petitboot components to build, and
	can also be used to specify that Petitboot should be run
	automatically at system start-up.

	Petitboot supports loading Linux kernel and initrd images
	from any device that can be mounted by Linux.  It can
	handle gzipped images and can also load images from the
	network using TFTP, NFS, HTTP, HTTPS, and SFTP.  Petitboot
	looks for bootloader config files on mountable devices in
	the system, and also uses the boot configuration sent to
	it from a DHCP server.
