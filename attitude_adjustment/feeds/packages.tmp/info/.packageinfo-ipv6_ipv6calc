Provides: 
Build-Variant: full
Section: ipv6

Source: ipv6calc-0.93.1.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:     ipv6calc is a small utility written in programming languate C to manipulate
  (not only) IPv6 addresses. Intentions were convering a given IPv6 address
  into compressed format, convering a given IPv6 address into the same format
  like shown in /proc/net/if_inet6 and (because it was not difficulty)
  migrating the Perl program ip6_int into. Now only one utiltity is needed to
  do a lot.
  This package contains an ipv6calc with the internal databases enabled.
