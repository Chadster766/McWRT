Title: Mako Templates for Python
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: Mako-0.2.5.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: Mako is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar,
non-XML syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum
performance. Mako's syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many
others, including Django templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and
Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an embedded Python (i.e. Python Server
Page) language, which refines the familiar ideas of componentized
layout and inheritance to produce one of the most straightforward and
flexible models available, while also maintaining close ties to Python
calling and scoping semantics.
