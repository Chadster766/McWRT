Title: GnuPG IPC library
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: libassuan-2.0.2.tar.bz2
Type: ipkg
Description:  The Libassuan package contains an IPC library used by some of the other
 GnuPG related packages. Libassuan's primary use is to allow a client to
 interact with a non-persistent server. Libassuan is not, however,
 limited to use with GnuPG servers and clients. It was designed to be
 flexible enough to meet the demands of many transaction based
 environments with non-persistent servers.
