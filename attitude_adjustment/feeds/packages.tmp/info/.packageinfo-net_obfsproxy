Description:   obfsproxy is a tool that attempts to circumvent censorship, by transforming
  the Tor traffic between the client and the bridge. This way, censors, who
  usually monitor traffic between the client and the bridge, will see
  innocent-looking transformed traffic instead of the actual Tor traffic.
