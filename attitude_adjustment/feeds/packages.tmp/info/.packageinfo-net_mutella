Title: Gnutella client with command line and http interface
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: mutella-0.4.5.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:  Mutella supports all the functionality required to participate as
 a full-featured node in the Gnutella network. "Full-featured" implies
 support for file search, download and sharing. It is optimized for a
 high-bandwidth connection, where it sets standards for server
 performance and stability, but can also run on a modest-speed line.
 .
 Mutella can either be controlled via a colourful text mode interface
 or via a web browser using a built in http interface.
