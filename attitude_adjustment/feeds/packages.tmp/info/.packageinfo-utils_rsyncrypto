Description:   rsyncrypto is a utility that encrypts a file (or a directory structure) in a
  way that ensures that local changes to the plain text file will result in
  local changes to the cipher text file. This, in turn, ensures that doing rsync
  to synchronize the encrypted files to another machine will have only a small
  impact on rsync's efficiency.
