Title: A library for parsing GNU style command line options
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: argtable2-13.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	Argtable is an ANSI C library for parsing GNU style command line options
	with a minimum of fuss.	It enables a program's command line syntax to be
	defined in the source code as an array of argtable structs. The command
	line is then parsed according to that specification and the resulting
	values are returned in those same structs where they are accessible to
	the main program. Both tagged (-v, --verbose, --foo=bar) and untagged
	arguments are supported, as are multiple instances of each argument.
