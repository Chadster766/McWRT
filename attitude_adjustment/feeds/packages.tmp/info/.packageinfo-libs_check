Title: Unit testing framework for C

Source: check-0.9.8.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:   Check features a simple interface for defining unit tests, putting little in
  the way of the developer. Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check
  can catch both assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation
  faults or other signals. The output from unit tests can be used within source
  code editors and IDEs.
