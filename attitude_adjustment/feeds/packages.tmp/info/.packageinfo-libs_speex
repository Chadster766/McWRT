Description: 	Open source patent-free speech compression codec library.
	Speex is an Open Source/Free Software patent-free audio compression 
	format designed for speech. The Speex Project aims to lower the 
	barrier of entry for voice applications by providing a free 
	alternative to expensive proprietary speech codecs. Moreover, Speex 
	is well-adapted to Internet applications and provides useful features 
	that are not present in most other codecs.

	This package contains the shared codec library, needed by other programs.
