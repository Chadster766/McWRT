Title: Network performance measurement tool
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: nuttcp-6.1.2.tar.bz2
Type: ipkg
Description:     nuttcp is a network performance measurement tool intended for use by network
  and system managers. Its most basic usage is to determine the raw TCP (or UDP)
  network layer throughput by transferring memory buffers from a source system
  across an interconnecting network to a destination system, either transferring
  data for a specified time interval, or alternatively transferring a specified
  number of bytes. In addition to reporting the achieved network throughput in
  Mbps, nuttcp also provides additional useful information related to the data
  transfer such as user, system, and wall-clock time, transmitter and receiver
  CPU utilization, and loss percentage (for UDP transfers).
