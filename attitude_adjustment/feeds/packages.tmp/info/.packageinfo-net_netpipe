Title: A Network Protocol Independent Performance Evaluator
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: NetPIPE-3.7.1.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	NetPIPE is a protocol independent performance tool that visually
	represents the network performance under a variety of conditions. It
	performs simple ping-pong tests, bouncing messages of increasing size
	between two processes, whether across a network or within an SMP
	system. Message sizes are chosen at regular intervals, and with slight
	perturbations, to provide a complete test of the communication system.
	Each data point involves many ping-pong tests to provide an accurate
	timing. Latencies are calculated by dividing the round trip time in
	half for small messages ( < 64 Bytes ).
