Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: yapsnmp-0.7.8.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:  This package contains a Python SNMP module based on the net-snmp (formerly 
 known as ucd-snmp) library. It's composed of a low level interface to the 
 library, created using SWIG, and a higher level python module removing all 
 the complexity out of dealing with SNMP.
