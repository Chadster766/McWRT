; Logging Configuration
;
; In this file, you configure logging to files or to
; the syslog system.
;
; "logger reload" at the CLI will reload configuration
; of the logging system.

[general]
; Customize the display of debug message time stamps
; this example is the ISO 8601 date format (yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS)
; see strftime(3) Linux manual for format specifiers
;dateformat=%F %T
;
; This appends the hostname to the name of the log files.
;appendhostname = yes
;
; This determines whether or not we log queue events to a file
; (defaults to yes).
;queue_log = no
;
; This determines whether or not we log generic events to a file
; (defaults to yes).
;event_log = no
;
;
; For each file, specify what to log.
;
; For console logging, you set options at start of
; Asterisk with -v for verbose and -d for debug
; See 'asterisk -h' for more information.
;
; Directory for log files is configures in asterisk.conf
; option astlogdir
;
[logfiles]
;
; Format is "filename" and then "levels" of debugging to be included:
;    debug
;    notice
;    warning
;    error
;    verbose
;    dtmf
;
; Special filename "console" represents the system console
;
; We highly recommend that you DO NOT turn on debug mode if you are simply
; running a production system.  Debug mode turns on a LOT of extra messages,
; most of which you are unlikely to understand without an understanding of
; the underlying code.  Do NOT report debug messages as code issues, unless
; you have a specific issue that you are attempting to debug.  They are
; messages for just that -- debugging -- and do not rise to the level of
; something that merit your attention as an Asterisk administrator.  Debug
; messages are also very verbose and can and do fill up logfiles quickly;
; this is another reason not to have debug mode on a production system unless
; you are in the process of debugging a specific issue.
