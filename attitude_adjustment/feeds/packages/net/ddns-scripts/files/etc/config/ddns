# In order to enable dynamic dns you need at least one section,
# and in that seciton the "enabled" option must be set to one
# 
# Each section represents an update to a different service
#
# You specify your domain name, your username and your password
# with the optins "domain", "username" and "password" respectively
#
# Next you need to specify the name of the service you are 
# connecting to "eg. dyndns.org".  The format of the update
# urls for several different dynamic dns services is specified
# in the /usr/lib/ddns/services file.  This list is hardly complete
# as there are many, many different dynamic dns services.  If your
# service is on the list you can merely specify it with the 
# "service_name" option.  Otherwise you will need to determine
# the format of the url to update with.  You can either add an
# entry to the /usr/lib/ddns/services file or specify this with
# the "update_url" option.
#
# We also need to specify the source of the ip address to associate with
# your domain.  The "ip_source" option can be "network", "interface"
# or "web", with "network" as the default.  
#
# If "ip_source" is "network" you specify a network section in your 
# /etc/network config file (e.g. "wan", which is the default) with
# the "ip_network" option.  If you specify "wan", you will update
# with whatever the ip for your wan is.
# 
# If "ip_source" is "interface" you specify a hardware interface 
# (e.g. "eth1") and whatever the current ip of this interface is
# will be associated with the domain when an update is performed.
#
# If "ip_source" is "script" you specify a script to obtain ip address.
# The "ip_script" option should contain path to your script.
#
# The last possibility is that "ip_source" is "web", which means
# that in order to obtain our ip address we will connect to a 
# website, and the first valid ip address listed on that page
# will be assumed to be ours.  If you are behind another firewall
# this is the best option since none of the local networks or 
# interfaces will have the external ip.  The website to connect
# to is specified by the "ip_url" option.  You may specify multiple
# urls in the option, separated by whitespace.
#
# Finally we need to specify how often to check whether we need
# to check whether the ip address has changed (and if so update
# it) and how often we need to force an update ( many services
# will expire your domain if you don't connect and do an update
# every so often).  Use the "check_interval" to specify how
# often to check whether an update is necessary, the "retry_interval"
# to specify how often to retry in case the update has failed, and
# the "force_interval" option to specify how often to force an
# update.  Specify the units for these values with the "check_unit",
# the "retry_init" and the "force_unit" options.  Units can be
# "days", "hours", "minutes" or "seconds".  The default force_unit
# is hours, the default retry_unit is seconds and the default
# check_unit is seconds.  The default check_interval is 600 seconds,
# or ten minutes.  The default retry_interval is 60 seconds, or one
# minute. The default force_interval is 72 hours or 3 days.
