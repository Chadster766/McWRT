    This is the OpenWRT FreeSWITCH minimal config.  It is modified from the the 
    FreeSWITCH default config to use only the modules in the freeswitch-minimal
    package, and is less exhaustive.  If you wish to view the default FreeSWITCH 
    config install package freeswitch-config-example and look under 
    /usr/share/freeswitch/examples/conf. Everything you see before you now traverses 
    down into all the directories including files which include more files.  The default
    config comes out of the box already working in most situations as a PBX.  This will
    allow you to get started testing and playing with various things in FreeSWITCH.
    
    Before you start to modify this default please visit this wiki page:
    
    http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Getting_Started_Guide#Some_stuff_to_try_out.21
    
    If all else fails you can read the FreeSWITCH FAQ located at:

  <!--#comment 
      All comments starting with #command will be preprocessed and never sent to the xml parser
      Valid instructions:
      #include ==> Include another file to this exact point
                   (partial xml should be encased in <include></include> tags)
      #set     ==> Set a global variable (can be expanded during preprocessing with $$ variables)
                   (note the double $$ which denotes preprocessor variables)
      #comment ==> A general comment such as this
      
      The preprocessor will compile the full xml document to ${prefix}/log/freeswitch.xml.fsxml
      Don't modify it while freeswitch is running cos it is mem mapped in most cases =D
      
      The same can be achieved with the <X-PRE-PROCESS> tag where the attrs 'cmd' and 'data' are
      parsed in the same way.

      vars.xml contains all the #set directives for the preprocessor.
