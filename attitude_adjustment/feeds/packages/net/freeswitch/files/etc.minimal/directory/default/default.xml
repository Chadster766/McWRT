	ATTENTION PLEASE READ THIS... (I know you won't but you've been warrned)
	
	Let it be known that this user can register without a password but since we do not assign
	this user a user_context and we don't authenticate this user they will be put in context 'public'.
	
	This isn't a security issue as the endpoint would be put into the same context 'public' as the 
	sofia profile that starts on 5080 by default. If you're paranoid just remove this file and 
	remove the external profile also.
	
	If you're this paranoid you might wanna go buy some more tinfoil and disconnect from the internets.
	
	Cuz we all know the internets is for pr0n anyway.
