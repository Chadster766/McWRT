Hi,

Your connection ${NAME} has changed it's state to ${STATE} at ${DATE}.

Following parameters were passed:

newstate     = ${STATE}
name         = ${NAME}
checkip      = ${CHECKIP}
device       = ${DEVICE}
warn_email   = ${WARN_EMAIL}

Packet counters:

replied      = ${REPLIED} packets replied
waiting      = ${WAITING} packets waiting for reply
timeout      = ${TIMEOUT} packets that have timed out (= packet loss)
reply_late   = ${REPLY_LATE} packets that received a reply after timeout
cons_rcvd    = ${CONS_RCVD} consecutively received replies in sequence
cons_wait    = ${CONS_WAIT} consecutive packets waiting for reply
cons_miss    = ${CONS_MISS} consecutive packets that have timed out
avg_rtt      = ${AVG_RTT} average rtt, notice that waiting and timed out packets have rtt = 0 when calculating this

Your LSM Daemon
