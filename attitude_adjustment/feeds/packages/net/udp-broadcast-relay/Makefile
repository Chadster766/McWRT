define Package/udp-broadcast-relay/description
	This program listens for packets on a specified UDP broadcast port.
	When a packet is received, it sends that packet to all specified interfaces but 
	the one it came from as though it originated from the original sender.
	The primary purpose of this is to allow games on machines on separated 
	local networks (Ethernet, WLAN) that use udp broadcasts to find each other to do so.
	It also works on ppp links, so you can log in from windows boxes (e.g. using pptp) 
	and play LAN-based games together. Currently, you have to care about upcoming or 
	downgoing interfaces yourself.
