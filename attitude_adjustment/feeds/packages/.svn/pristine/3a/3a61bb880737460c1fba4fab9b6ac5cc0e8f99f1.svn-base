	  Defines the path to the Maemo kernel zImage.

	  The image can be extracted from the Fiasco firmware image.
	  Use the proprietary flasher to extract the image. The
	  opensource tool "0xFFFF" is not able to extract the zImage correctly.

	  The zImage defined here will be included in the OpenWrt rootfs
	  for kexec-ing of the Maemo operating system. The Maemo rootfs
	  has to be installed on the n810's "rootfs" MTD partition (MTD4).
