Description: Fix reading FTP data is ASCII mode
 In ASCII mode, if you don't have a line in the next block that you're
 trying to read, then ftplib would set the first character to '\0'.
 .
 Upstream probably intented to return an empty string when requesting
 to read only 1 character since that doesn't make much sense when the
 EOL delimiter is 2 characters already (\r\n). However, due to the
 way data is read, max can be set to 1 just after having read max-1
 legitimate bytes and we should not be overwriting the first byte.
 .
 Patch is not submitted upstream since upstream is not actively
 maintaining it.
