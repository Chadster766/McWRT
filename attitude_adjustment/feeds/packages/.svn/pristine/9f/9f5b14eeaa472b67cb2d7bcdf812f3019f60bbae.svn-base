# In order to enable dynamic dns you need at least one section, and in that
# seciton the "enabled" option must be set to one
# 
# Each section represents an update to a different service
#
# You specify your domain name, your username and your password with the optins
# "domain", "username" and "password" respectively
#
# Next you need to specify the name of the service you are connecting to "eg.
# dyndns".  The list of the available dns services is specified in the
# /usr/lib/ddns/services file.
#
# We also need to specify the source of the ip address to associate with your
# domain.  The "ip_source" option can be "network", "interface" or "web", with
# "network" as the default.  
#
# If "ip_source" is "network" you specify a network section in your
# /etc/network config file (e.g. "wan", which is the default) with the
# "ip_network" option.  If you specify "wan", you will update with whatever the
# ip for your wan is.
# 
# If "ip_source" is "interface" you specify a hardware interface (e.g. "eth1")
# and whatever the current ip of this interface is will be associated with the
# domain when an update is performed.
#
# If "ip_source" is "script" you specify a script to obtain ip address.  The
# "ip_script" option should contain path to your script.
#
# The last possibility is that "ip_source" is "web", which means that in order
# to obtain our ip address we will connect to a website, and the first valid ip
# address listed on that page will be assumed to be ours.  If you are behind
# another firewall this is the best option since none of the local networks or
# interfaces will have the external ip.  The website to connect to is specified
# by the "ip_url" option.
#
# Finally we need to specify how often to check whether we need to check
# whether the ip address has changed (and if so update it), this is only valid
# for the "web" method. Use the "check_interval" to specify how often to check
# whether an update is necessary. Specify the units for this value with the
# "check_unit" option.  Units can be "days", "hours", "minutes" or "seconds".
# The default check_interval is 600 seconds, or ten minutes.
#
# For yaddns all ip_* options are system-wide and are taken from the first
# enabled section.
