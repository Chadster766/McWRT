	help
	  This code is takes a wandering minstrel approach. Wander around the
	  different rates, singing wherever you can. And then, look at the
	  performance, and make a choice. Note that the wandering minstrel will
	  always wander in directions where he/she feels he/she will get paid
	  the best for his/her work.

config MADWIFI_RCA_SAMPLERATE
	bool "Use the SampleRate rate control algorithm"
	help
	  SampleRate decides on the transmission bit-rate based on the past
	  history of performance; it keeps a record of the number of successive
	  failures, the number of successful transmits and the total transmission
	  time along with the destination for that bit-rate. Stale samples are
	  removed based on a EWMA windowing mechanism. If in the sampling
	  process, no successful acknowledgment is received or the number of
	  packets sent is multiple of 10 on a specific link, it transmits the
	  packet with the highest rate which has not failed 4 successive times.
	  Other than that it transmits packets at the rate which has the lowest
	  average transmission time.
