	  If this option is off, the first returned address will be used.
	  This may cause problems when your DNS server is IPv6-capable and
	  is returning IPv6 host addresses too. If IPv6 address
	  precedes IPv4 one in DNS reply, busybox network applets
	  (e.g. wget) will use IPv6 address. On an IPv6-incapable host
	  or network applets will fail to connect to the host

	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FTPD
	help
	  Some ftp clients (among them KDE's Konqueror) issue illegal
	  "LIST -l" requests. This option works around such problems.
	  It might prevent you from listing files starting with "-" and
	  it increases the code size by ~40 bytes.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_HTTPD_SETUID
	bool "Enable -u <user> option"
	default n
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_HTTPD

	help
	  This option enables support for running scripts through an

	help
	  Activate or deactivate the specified interfaces. This applet makes
	  use of either "ifconfig" and "route" or the "ip" command to actually
	  configure network interfaces. Therefore, you will probably also want
	  to enable either IFCONFIG and ROUTE, or enable
	  FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IP and the various IP options. Of
	  course you could use non-busybox versions of these programs, so
	  against my better judgement (since this will surely result in plenty
	  of support questions on the mailing list), I do not force you to
	  enable these additional options. It is up to you to supply either
	  "ifconfig", "route" and "run-parts" or the "ip" command, either
	  via busybox or via standalone utilities.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_TELNET

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_TELNET_TTYPE
	bool "Pass TERM type to remote host"
	default y
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_TELNET
	help
	  Setting this option will forward the TERM environment variable to the
	  remote host you are connecting to. This is useful to make sure that
	  things like ANSI colors and other control sequences behave.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_TELNET_AUTOLOGIN
	bool "Pass USER type to remote host"
	default n
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_TELNET
	help
	  Setting this option will forward the USER environment variable to the

	  log into a machine without telling the username (autologin). This
	  option enables `-a' and `-l USER' arguments.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_TELNETD
	bool "telnetd"
	default y
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	  A daemon for the TELNET protocol, allowing you to log onto the host
	  running the daemon. Please keep in mind that the TELNET protocol
	  sends passwords in plain text. If you can't afford the space for an
	  SSH daemon and you trust your network, you may say 'y' here. As a
	  more secure alternative, you should seriously consider installing the
	  very small Dropbear SSH daemon instead:
		http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html

	  Note that for busybox telnetd to work you need several things:
	  First of all, your kernel needs:
		  UNIX98_PTYS=y
		  DEVPTS_FS=y

	  Next, you need a /dev/pts directory on your root filesystem:

		  $ ls -ld /dev/pts
		  drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 0 Sep 23 13:21 /dev/pts/

	  Next you need the pseudo terminal master multiplexer /dev/ptmx:

		  $ ls -la /dev/ptmx
		  crw-rw-rw-  1 root tty 5, 2 Sep 23 13:55 /dev/ptmx

	  Any /dev/ttyp[0-9]* files you may have can be removed.
	  Next, you need to mount the devpts filesystem on /dev/pts using:

		  mount -t devpts devpts /dev/pts

	  You need to be sure that busybox has LOGIN and
	  FEATURE_SUID enabled. And finally, you should make
	  certain that Busybox has been installed setuid root:

		chown root.root /bin/busybox
		chmod 4755 /bin/busybox

	  with all that done, telnetd _should_ work....


config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_TELNETD_STANDALONE

	bool "Support -w SEC option (inetd wait mode)"
	default n
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_TELNETD_STANDALONE
	help
	  This option allows you to run telnetd in "inet wait" mode.
	  Example inetd.conf line (note "wait", not usual "nowait"):

	  telnet stream tcp wait root /bin/telnetd telnetd -w10

	  In this example, inetd passes _listening_ socket_ as fd 0
	  to telnetd when connection appears.
	  telnetd will wait for connections until all existing
	  connections are closed, and no new connections
	  appear during 10 seconds. Then it exits, and inetd continues
	  to listen for new connections.

	  This option is rarely used. "tcp nowait" is much more usual
	  way of running tcp services, including telnetd.
	  You most probably want to say N here.
