          good luck.

config AR6000_WLAN_DEBUG
	bool "Enable retrieval of firmware debugging information"

	default n
	help
	  The AR6k firmware maintains a log of debugging events that
	  gets flushed to the host on various occasions. Retrieval of
	  this data is very slow, taking several seconds.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config AR6000_WLAN_RESET
	bool "Soft-reset when shutting down"
	depends on AR6000_WLAN
	default n
	help
	  The AR6k module can be explicitly reset when shutting down
	  the device. This adds a delay of about two seconds to suspend,
	  module removal, and so on. Since the WLAN SDIO function is
	  generally disabled soon thereafter anyway, this reset seems
	  superfluous.

	  If in doubt, say N.
