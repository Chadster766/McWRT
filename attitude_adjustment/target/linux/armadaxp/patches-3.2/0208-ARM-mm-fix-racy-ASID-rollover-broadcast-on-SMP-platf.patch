Subject: [PATCH 208/609] ARM: mm: fix racy ASID rollover broadcast on SMP
 platforms

If ASID rollover is detected on a CPU in an SMP system, a synchronous
IPI call is made to force the secondaries to reallocate their current
ASIDs.

There is a problem where a CPU may be interrupted in the cpu_switch_mm
code with the context ID held in r1. After servicing the IPI, the
context ID register will be updated with an ASID from the previous
generation, polluting the TLB for when that ASID becomes valid in the
new generation.

This patch disables interrupts during cpu_switch_mm for SMP systems,
preventing incoming rollover broadcasts from being serviced while the
register state is inconsistent. Additionally, the context resetting code
is modified to call cpu_switch_mm, rather than setting the context ID
register directly, so that the TTBR always agrees with the ASID.
