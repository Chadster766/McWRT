Subject: [PATCH 584/609] MTD, UBI: Fix ubi_init error during boot - allow to
 mount root from UBI NAND

- UBI module was being initialized earlier than NAND driver. Due to that
  module initialization was failing and mounting rootfs from NAND was not
  possible.
  This commit changes UBI module initialization order and makes mounting
  root from NAND possible.
