Subject: [PATCH 221/609] ARM: LPAE: Use generic dma_addr_t type definition

This patch uses the types.h implementation in asm-generic to define the
dma_addr_t type as the same width as phys_addr_t.

NOTE: this is a temporary patch until the corresponding patches unifying
the dma_addr_t and removing the dma64_addr_t are merged into mainline.
