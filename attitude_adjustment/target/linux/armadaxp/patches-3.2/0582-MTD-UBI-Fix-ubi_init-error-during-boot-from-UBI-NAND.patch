Subject: [PATCH 582/609] MTD, UBI: Fix ubi_init error, during boot from UBI
 NAND

Error was due to initialization UBI before NAND. This led to error during boot
from an UBI volume on NAND device. The initialization order is determined by
the order of linking modules into kernel. The NAND module is placed in
arch/arm/plat-armada/mv_drivers_lsp/mv_mtd/, so NAND is now linked before UBI.

Bug fix - BTS #271 'UBIFS is configured in a wrong place'
