Subject: [PATCH 587/609] XP,DSMP: Fix booting of the secondary CPUs after PM
 related changes to the SMP

- Primary CPU is configuring temporary page tables and other initial data
  for the secondary CPUs to use during boot but the secondary CPUs were unable
  to read that data after waking up as it was located in the primary's CPU
  cache.
  Flushing primary CPU's cache just before waking up other CPUs is necassary to
  maintain memory consistency in the system during the initial stage of the SMP
  initialization.
