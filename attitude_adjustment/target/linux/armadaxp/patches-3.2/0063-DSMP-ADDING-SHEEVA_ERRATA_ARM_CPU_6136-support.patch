+        help
+	The scenario required to hit the bug starts with an LDM which is a cross-boundary, cross-page address.  The first part
+	hits in the cache, while the second part suffers an MMU fault.  Under this scenario, the source register does not get
+	restored after the fault occurs, causing data corruption.  NOTE: This can only happen on an LDM whose source is also
+	one of the destinations.  This can also only happen if the LDM has two destination registers in the register list.
+	Workaround
+	Set the "ldstm_first Two Sgl" bit[12] in the Auxiliary Debug Modes Control 0 Register.  This effectively forces the first
+	issue of a LDSTM to be a single word, avoiding the buggy condition.
